“Is this the very most important thing I should be doing with my time and resources right now?”
                

## Page: 3
He stopped attending conference calls that he only had a couple of minutes of interest in. He stopped sitting in on the weekly update call because he didn’t need the information. He stopped attending meetings on his calendar if he didn’t have a direct contribution to make. He explained to me, “Just because I was invited didn’t seem a good enough reason to attend.”
                

## Page: 3
Instead of spinning his wheels trying to get everything done, he could get the right things done.
                

## Page: 3
Instead of making just a millimeter of progress in a million directions he began to generate tremendous momentum towards accomplishing the things that were truly vital.
                

## Page: 4
In this example is the basic value proposition of Essentialism: only once you give yourself permission to stop trying to do it all, to stop saying yes to everyone, can you make your highest contribution towards the things that really matter.
                

## Page: 6
Less but better.

“Am I investing in the right activities?” There are far more activities and opportunities in the world than we have time and resources to invest in.
                

## Page: 6
Essentialism is not about how to get more things done; it’s about how to get the right things done. It doesn’t mean just doing less for the sake of less either. It is about making the wisest possible investment of your time and energy in order to operate at our highest point of contribution by doing only what is essential.
                

## Page: 7
The way of the Essentialist means living by design, not by default. Instead of making choices reactively, the Essentialist deliberately distinguishes the vital few from the trivial many, eliminates the nonessentials, and then removes obstacles so the essential things have clear, smooth passage. In other words, Essentialism is a disciplined, systematic approach for determining where our highest point of contribution lies, then making execution of those things almost effortless.
                

## Page: 8
The Model
                

## Page: 9
The way of the Essentialist is the path to being in control of our own choices.
                

## Page: 10
If you don’t prioritize your life, someone else will.
                

## Page: 14
for many, falling into “the undisciplined pursuit of more” was a key reason for failure.
                

## Page: 16
But when we try to do it all and have it all, we find ourselves making trade-offs at the margins that we would never take on as our intentional strategy. When we don’t purposefully and deliberately choose where to focus our energies and time, other people—our bosses, our colleagues, our clients, and even our families—will choose for us, and before long we’ll have lost sight of everything that is meaningful and important.

ESSENCE: WHAT IS THE CORE MIND-SET OF AN ESSENTIALIST?
                

## Page: 20
1. Individual choice: We can choose how to spend our energy and time.
                

## Page: 20
2. The prevalence of noise: Almost everything is noise, and a very few things are exceptionally valuable.
                

## Page: 20
3. The reality of trade-offs: We can’t have it all or do it all.
                

## Page: 23
Many of us say yes to things because we are eager to please and make a difference.
                

## Page: 23
To eliminate nonessentials means saying no to someone. Often.
                

## Page: 26
What if we stopped celebrating being busy as a measurement of importance? What if instead we celebrated how much time we had spent listening, pondering, meditating, and enjoying time with the most important people in our lives?
                

## Page: 32
Essentialism is not a way to do one more thing; it is a different way of doing everything.
                

## Page: 32
“I choose to,” “Only a few things really matter,” and “I can do anything but not everything.”
                

## Page: 35
Our options may be things, but a choice—a choice is an action.
                

## Page: 35
This experience brought me to the liberating realization that while we may not always have control over our options, we always have control over how we choose among them.
                

## Page: 38
choice is at the very core of what it means to be an Essentialist.
                

## Page: 43
“What is the most valuable result I could achieve in this job?”
                

## Page: 43
Working hard is important. But more effort does not necessarily yield more results. “Less but better” does.
                

## Page: 44
“the Law of the Vital Few.”
                

## Page: 44
Sometimes what you don’t do is just as important as what you do.”6
                

## Page: 45
“You cannot overestimate the unimportance of practically everything.”9
                

## Page: 50
“You have to look at every opportunity and say, ‘Well, no … I’m sorry. We’re not going to do a thousand different things that really won’t contribute much to the end result we are trying to achieve.’ ”
                

## Page: 52
we can either make the hard choices for ourselves or allow others—whether our colleagues, our boss, or our customers—to decide for us.
                

## Page: 55
As painful as they can sometimes be, trade-offs represent a significant opportunity. By forcing us to weigh both options and strategically select the best one for us, we significantly increase our chance of achieving the outcome we want.
                

## Page: 60
To discern what is truly essential we need space to think, time to look and listen, permission to play, wisdom to sleep, and the discipline to apply highly selective criteria to the choices we make.
                

## Page: 62
Essentialists spend as much time as possible exploring, listening, debating, questioning, and thinking. But their exploration is not an end in itself. The purpose of the exploration is to discern the vital few from the trivial many.
                

## Page: 68
“Can you remember what it was like to be bored? It doesn’t happen anymore.”
                

## Page: 68
Here’s another paradox for you: the faster and busier things get, the more we need to build thinking time into our schedule. And the noisier things get, the more we need to build quiet reflection spaces in which we can truly focus.
                

## Page: 74
In every set of facts, something essential is hidden.
                

## Page: 76
Essentialists are powerful observers and listeners.

Capture the headline. Look for the lead in your day, your week, your life. Small, incremental changes are hard to see in the moment but over time can have a huge cumulative effect.
                

## Page: 87
play is an antidote to stress, and this is key because stress, in addition to being an enemy of productivity, can actually shut down the creative, inquisitive, exploratory parts of our brain.

Protecting the Asset
                

## Page: 94
The best asset we have for making a contribution to the world is ourselves.
                

## Page: 99
In a nutshell, sleep is what allows us to operate at our highest level of contribution so that we can achieve more, in less time.
                

## Page: 102
Sleep will enhance your ability to explore, make connections, and do less but better throughout your waking hours.

“No More Yes. It’s Either HELL YEAH! Or No,” the popular
                

## Page: 103
“If the answer isn’t a definite yes then it should be a no.”
                

## Page: 107
Making our criteria both selective and explicit affords us a systematic tool for discerning what is essential and filtering out the things that are not.

“If I didn’t already own this, how much would I spend to buy it?” Likewise, in your life, the killer question when deciding what activities to eliminate is: “If I didn’t have this opportunity, what would I be willing to do to acquire it?”
                

## Page: 118
“What, of my list of competing priorities, should I say yes to?”
                

## Page: 118
Instead, ask the essential question: “What will I say no to?”

When there is a serious lack of clarity about what the team stands for and what their goals and roles are, people experience confusion, stress, and frustration. When there is a high level of clarity, on the other hand, people thrive.
                

## Page: 124
In the same way, when individuals are involved in too many disparate activities—even good activities—they can fail to achieve their essential mission. One reason for this is that the activities don’t work in concert, so they don’t add up into a meaningful whole.
                

## Page: 124
When teams are really clear about their purpose and their individual roles, on the other hand, it is amazing what happens to team dynamics.
                

## Page: 126
An essential intent, on the other hand, is both inspirational and concrete, both meaningful and measurable. Done right, an essential intent is one decision that settles one thousand later decisions.
                

## Page: 126
One strategic choice eliminates a universe of other options and maps a course for the next five, ten, or even twenty years of your life.

## Page: 128
Living with Intent Essential intent applies to so much more than your job description or your company’s mission statement; a true essential intent is one that guides your greater sense of purpose, and helps you chart your life’s path.
                

## Page: 130
It takes asking tough questions, making real trade-offs, and exercising serious discipline to cut out the competing priorities that distract us from our true intention.

A true Essentialist, Peter Drucker believed that “people are effective because they say no.”

“sunk-cost bias.”
                

## Page: 146
Sunk-cost bias is the tendency to continue to invest time, money, or energy into something we know is a losing proposition simply because we have already incurred, or sunk, a cost that cannot be recouped.
                

## Page: 146
The more we invest in something, the harder it is to let go.

“the endowment effect,” our tendency to undervalue things that aren’t ours and to overvalue things because we already own them.
                

## Page: 149
PRETEND YOU DON’T OWN IT YET Tom Stafford describes a simple antidote to the endowment effect.6 Instead of asking, “How much do I value this item?” we should ask, “If I did not own this item, how much would I pay to obtain it?”
                

## Page: 151
STATUS QUO BIAS

The tendency to continue doing something simply because we have always done it is sometimes called the “status quo bias.”

a good editor is someone who uses deliberate subtraction to actually add life to the ideas, setting, plot, and characters.
                

## Page: 157
Likewise, in life, disciplined editing can help add to your level of contribution. It increases your ability to focus on and give energy to the things that really matter.

## Page: 160
“What Is an Editor?” there are “two basic questions the editor should be addressing to the author: Are you saying what you want to say? and, Are you saying it as clearly and concisely as possible?”
                

## Page: 161
We need to eliminate multiple meaningless activities and replace them with one very meaningful activity.
                

## Page: 161
CORRECT An editor’s job is not just to cut or condense but also to make something right.
                

## Page: 161
EDIT LESS This may seem a little counterintuitive. But the best editors don’t feel the need to change everything.
                

## Page: 162
Becoming an editor in our lives also includes knowing when to show restraint. One way we can do this is by editing our tendency to step
                

## Page: 164
get clear with each member of the team about expectations, accountability, and outcomes.
                

## Page: 166
After all, if you don’t set boundaries—there won’t be any.
                

## Page: 166
Essentialists, on the other hand, see boundaries as empowering.
                

## Page: 168
DON’T ROB PEOPLE OF THEIR PROBLEMS I am not saying we should never help people. We should serve, and love, and make a difference in the lives of others, of course. But when people make their problem our problem, we aren’t helping them; we’re enabling them.
                

## Page: 168
Once we take their problem for them, all we’re doing is taking away their ability to solve it.
                

## Page: 169
when we don’t set clear boundaries in our lives we can end up imprisoned by the limits others have set for us.

Essentialists invest the time they have saved by eliminating the nonessentials into designing a system to make execution almost effortless.
                

## Page: 176
A “buffer” can be defined literally as something that prevents two things from coming into contact and harming each other.
                

## Page: 178
The Nonessentialist tends to always assume a best-case scenario. We all know those people (and many of us, myself included, have been that person) who chronically underestimate how long something will really take:
                

## Page: 180
USE EXTREME PREPARATION When I was a graduate student at Stanford I learned the key to receiving top grades was extreme preparation.
                

## Page: 183
simply to add a 50 percent buffer to the amount of time we estimate it will take to complete a task or project (if 50 percent seems overly generous, consider how frequently things actually do take us 50 percent longer than expected).

Constraints, he is told, are the obstacles holding the whole system back.
                

## Page: 187
But if you really want to improve the overall functioning of the system—whether that system is a manufacturing process, a procedure in your department, or some routine in your daily life—you need to identify the “slowest hiker.”
                

## Page: 189
An Essentialist produces more—brings forth more—by removing more instead of doing more.
                

## Page: 190
IDENTIFY THE “SLOWEST HIKER” Instead of just jumping into the project, take a few minutes to think. Ask yourself, “What are all the obstacles standing between me and getting this done?”

Essentialist starts small and celebrates progress. Instead of going for the big, flashy wins that don’t really matter, the Essentialist pursues small and simple wins in areas that are essential.
                

## Page: 196
Research has shown that of all forms of human motivation the most effective one is progress. Why? Because a small, concrete win creates momentum and

Jack Dorsey, the cofounder of Twitter and founder of Square, has an interesting approach to his weekly routine. He has divided up his week into themes. Monday is for management meetings and “running the company” work. Tuesday is for product development. Wednesday is for marketing, communications, and growth. Thursday is for developers and partnerships. Friday is for the company and its culture.

in fact we can easily do two things at the same time: wash the dishes and listen to the radio, eat and talk, clear the clutter on our desk while thinking about where to go for lunch, text message while watching television, and so on. What we can’t do is concentrate on two things at the same time.

Living Essentially There are two ways of thinking about Essentialism. The first is to think of it as something you do occasionally. The second is to think of it as something you are.

MAJORING IN MINOR ACTIVITIES There is a big difference between being a Nonessentialist who happens to apply Essentialist practices and an Essentialist who only occasionally slips back into some Nonessentialist practices.

If you allow yourself to fully embrace Essentialism—to really live it, in everything you do, whether at home or at work—it can become a part of the way you see and understand the world.

THE ELEMENTS OF LEADING AS AN ESSENTIALIST
                

## Page: 242
Everything to everyone Essentialist Less but better TALENT Nonessentialist Hires people frantically and creates a “Bozo explosion.” Essentialist Ridiculously selective on talent and removes people who hold the team back. STRATEGY Nonessentialist Pursues a straddled strategy where everything is a priority. Essentialist Defines an essential intent by answering the question, “If we could only do one thing, what would it be?” Eliminates the nonessential distractions. EMPOWERMENT Nonessentialist Allows ambiguity over who is doing what. Decisions are capricious. Essentialist

Focuses on each team member’s highest role and goal of contribution. COMMUNICATION Nonessentialist Talks in code. Essentialist Listens to get to what is essential.
