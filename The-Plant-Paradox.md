As the old saying goes, “You are what you eat.” But you are also what the thing you ate, ate. When you consume organically raised produce and pastured animal products—and I do not mean free-range—the nutrients in the plants and the nutrients the plants got from the soil (as well as the plants the animals ate) pass into your body and are incorporated into every one of your cells. Knowing how the food you eat was grown and raised is not just a lifestyle choice; it also directly affects your health.

The Plant Paradox Program is actually a microbiome- and mitochondria-centric program that recommends a diverse array of the right plant foods at the right time, prepared the right way, in the right amounts.

Lectins are the cause of sinus issues, because excessive mucous production is the first line of defense to entrap the lectins we consume.

What I was looking for is the actual cause of inflammation, which, if Hippocrates is right (and he is), would stop inflammation in its tracks. In other words, it wasn’t that my diet was quelling the inflammation in Tony’s body, which most healing diets purport to do. It was, in fact, that my diet was removing the root causes of inflammation, and once those were removed, his body was capable of healing itself without the need for any anti-inflammatory compounds.
                

## Yellow highlight | Page: 72
This multiplicity of microbes has collectively been called the microbiome, although scientists are now using the term “holobiome” as more descriptive; holobiome includes not just the microbes in your gut, but also those on your skin and even in the cloud of bacteria surrounding each of us (much like Pig Pen in the Peanuts cartoons).
                

## Yellow highlight | Page: 84
Increased intestinal permeability from lectins and LPSs, as well as the regular use of NSAIDs and acid-reducing drugs, produces what is commonly called leaky gut syndrome.
                

## Yellow highlight | Page: 85
that all autoimmune diseases are caused by alterations in the good bugs and the bad bugs that live in your gut and your mouth and on your skin, along with a change in the permeability of your gut wall and mouth and gums.

there are nine times as many fibers leading up to the brain from the gut. There are actually more neurons in your gut than in your entire spinal cord. You truly have a second brain within your gut, and that brain is controlled by your holobiome. Unlike what I and most other doctors were taught in medical school, the vagus nerve exists to get information to the brain from the gut, not the other way around. I tell my patients that when they have a gut

Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics
                

## Yellow highlight | Page: 98
these antibiotics effectively allowed doctors to carpet-bomb an infection without worrying about exactly which bacterium was the culprit. We
                

## Yellow highlight | Page: 98
Every time you take a course of Levaquin, ciprofloxacin, or another broad-spectrum antibiotic for a urinary-tract or another infection, you kill most of the microbes in your gut. Shockingly, it can take up to two years for them to return. Many may be gone forever.
                

## Yellow highlight | Page: 99
Your holobiome is like a mature rain forest, an incredibly complex ecosystem where one species’ existence is dependent on several others for survival.

Baytril’s heavy use on animals could make humans resistant to Cipro, which is used to treat salmonella, campylobacter, and other food-borne diseases (as well as anthrax) in humans. This means that if a person consumes bacteria in inadequately cooked meat or handles such meat improperly and becomes ill, s/he may not respond to treatment with Cipro.
                

## Yellow highlight | Page: 101
Broad-spectrum antibiotics make pigs, chickens, and other animals grow faster, larger, and fatter. And if they have that effect in animals, it’s unsurprising that they’d do the same to humans.

Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)
                

## Yellow highlight | Page: 102
However, we now know that NSAIDs damage the mucosal barrier in the small intestine and colon, allowing lectins, LPSs, and other foreign substances to pass through the intestinal wall, initiating a war within your body. Evidence of the war is increasing inflammation, which you feel as pain. And the more pain you have, the more NSAIDs you take.

Also remember: The precursors of Advil and Aleve, ibuprofen and Naprosyn, were recognized as so dangerous when they were introduced in the 1970s that they were available only as prescription drugs.
                

## Yellow highlight | Page: 104
Stomach-Acid Blockers Let me count the reasons acid-blocking drugs such as Zantac, Prilosec, Nexium, and Protonix are to be avoided at all costs.
                

## Yellow highlight | Page: 104
The acid in the stomach is so powerful that only a few important bacteria can tolerate it as their home; as a result, many of the bad bacteria that you swallow never make it out alive.
                

## Yellow highlight | Page: 104
Acids from the stomach normally confine bacteria to the large intestine through a process called the acid gradient.
                

## Yellow highlight | Page: 104
lacking stomach acid, bad bacteria and even good bacteria can easily crawl up from their designated home in the colon into your small intestine, where they don’t belong.
                

## Yellow highlight | Page: 105
The use of PPIs, such as Prilosec and Nexium, doesn’t just interfere with the proper functioning of your stomach acid. PPIs not only stop stomach acid production, but also can kill off your mitochondria’s ability to produce energy in every cell in the body via their own proton pumps.
                

## Yellow highlight | Page: 105
Remarkably, these PPIs cross the blood-brain barrier and poison your brain’s mitochondria. One study showed a 44 percent increased risk of dementia among 74,000 people aged seventy-five and older who had used these drugs, compared with those who did not.
                

## Yellow highlight | Page: 105
When these acid blockers were introduced in the 1980s, they were considered so dangerous that they had to be prescribed by a physician.
                

## Yellow highlight | Page: 106
People who use acid blockers have three times the likelihood of getting pneumonia,13 which these foreign bugs cause, than those who don’t use such drugs.

Finally, because stomach acid is necessary to break down dietary protein into amino acids before they can be absorbed in your gut, we have produced an entire generation of senior citizens who are protein malnourished. That’s

Artificial Sweetener Trojan Horses •   THE ENEMY: All artificial sweeteners, specifically saccharin (Sweet’n Low, Sweet Twin, and Necta Sweet), aspartame (Equal and NutraSweet), acesulfame K (also in Equal and NutraSweet), sucralose (Splenda), and neotame.
                

## Yellow highlight | Page: 110
Also steer clear of soft drinks or sports drinks, any health or protein bar that contains any of these sweeteners, as well as any form of sugar, including corn, agave syrup, or pure cane sugar. Ditto for any processed foods with such sweeteners.

The use of mouthwashes, which kill mouth bacteria as they give you that “minty clean” breath, dramatically increases blood pressure.19 If you use mouthwash and have been told you need to take medication to lower your blood pressure, ditch the mouthwash ASAP. Triclosan in hand sanitizers and toothpaste has also been shown to produce bladder cancer and to stimulate precancerous cells to proliferate.

The Fat-Storage Hormone Most hormone disruptors mimic the action of estrogen, whose main purpose is to tell cells to store fat in anticipation of an upcoming pregnancy. Now, 365 days a year, we store fat for an upcoming pregnancy regardless of our age or even our gender!

Arsenic in Our Food—No Kidding You’ll recall that arsenic, which can be found in chicken, is a not just an antibiotic and a poison, but also a hormone disruptor. Chicken has become a large part of the standard American diet, replacing beef, lamb, pork, and other meats.

DISRUPTOR 6: Genetically Modified Foods and the Herbicide Roundup Herbicides, insecticides, and pesticides are different forms of biocides.
                

## Yellow highlight | Page: 121
That glyphosate remains on the grains and beans and is fed to our livestock in feed lots and incorporated into their fat, meat, and milk, which you then eat or drink. Almost all grains and beans fed to industrial farm animals are also GMO.
                

## Yellow highlight | Page: 122
The glyphosate in whole grains, soybeans, and other beans had poisoned these women’s own production of serotonin and tyrosine. This not only paralyzes the shikimate pathway and hinders our supply of those three amino acids, but also alters the composition of our normal gut flora by causing good gut bugs to die off.
                

## Yellow highlight | Page: 122
Roundup also paralyzes key liver enzymes (cytochrome P450 enzymes) that convert vitamin D to a form that your body can use to recycle cholesterol—meaning Roundup effectively raises your cholesterol! Plus, you need that vitamin D to foster repair of your now-damaged gut wall.39 Again: you are what you eat, and what the things you are eating, ate.

Blue light suppresses the production of melatonin, the hormone that helps you fall asleep, and sleep deprivation is associated with obesity.46 Blue light also stimulates ghrelin and cortisol, which are, respectively, the “hunger” and “awake” hormones. And because our genetic programming associates blue light with daylight, this constant exposure tricks our bodies into thinking we’re perpetually in the season with longer daylight hours (summer).

To summarize, in ancient times when food was scarce, weight gain from consuming the lectins in grains and beans was a huge benefit, but today, the same result works against us. Now let’s move to the second way lectins work for us and against us.

Every time you waver, every time you rationalize something about what you plan to eat, every time you hear a little voice in your head saying, “But this is healthy food,” stop and return immediately to Rule Number 1 (below).

RULE NUMBER 3: Fruit Might as Well Be Candy
                

## Yellow highlight | Page: 170
Forget any idea that fruit is a health food.
                

## Yellow highlight | Page: 170
As you’ve learned, eating fruit in season allowed our ancestors to fatten up for the winter, but now fruit is ubiquitous 365 days a year. The next time you ask for a fruit salad as a “healthy” breakfast, I suggest that instead you order a bowl of Skittles candy. Go ahead—it’s the same poisonous stuff. The corollary to Rule Number 3 is this: If it has seeds, it’s a fruit!

Store fat for the winter. Moreover (and this will surprise most of you), eating the fructose in fruit causes your kidneys to swell and suffer injury, which can destroy them.

If you eat meat, poultry, farm-raised fish, eggs, and dairy products, you are largely an ear of corn and a pile of soybeans, because that is what almost all industrially raised food animals are regularly fed.
                

## Yellow highlight | Page: 174
Because our livestock have been routinely given antibiotics, they have become hosts to multiple forms of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Almost weekly, we hear another report of a meat or chicken recall because of an outbreak of deadly diarrhea. Wait—I’m not done yet. It turns out that chicken (eggs and flesh), pork, beef, and cow’s milk are contaminated with aflatoxins, toxic by-products of molds and fungi that grow on corn, wheat, and soybeans.

An Overview of the Plant Paradox Program THE REVOLUTIONARY APPROACH of the Plant Paradox Program will help you achieve both optimal health and the ability to manage your weight by feeding you and your good gut bugs what you both need. We’ll get into the specifics of the three phases that constitute the Plant Paradox Program in the following three chapters. Meanwhile, here are the basics: •   PHASE 1: This three-day cleanse begins the process of repairing your gut, fortifying the good microbes, and banishing most of the bad microbes. At the end of the three days, your gut organisms will have changed, and therefore, your gut has changed. But you must move directly from Phase 1 to Phase 2 to prevent the almost immediate return of the bad guys. •   PHASE 2: Here is where the Plant Paradox Program really kicks in. All I ask is that you give me two weeks, and in return I’ll give you back your life. After two weeks, you will feel and see the change—it is that powerful. And after six weeks, you’ll have engrained these new eating habits. During this time, I’m going to ask you to eliminate or reduce certain foods and eat more of others. Here’s an overview: •   Initially, you’ll eliminate major lectins (grains and legumes, including corn and soybeans, which also contain estrogenlike substances), GMO foods, crops treated with Roundup, and many saturated fats. This includes whole-grain products, which hypersensitize the immune system. But fear not, vegetarians and vegans, I have a solution for you below. •   Eliminate all sugars and artificial sweeteners. •   Minimize intake of most omega-6 fats, which prompt the body’s attack mode, encouraging fat storage and hunger. •   Eliminate industrial farm–raised poultry (including so-called free-range poultry) and livestock (along with their dairy products) and all farm-raised fish, which are fed antibiotics, corn, and beans full of omega-6s and laced with Roundup. •   You may have a small serving of nuts, guacamole, or simply half a Hass avocado as a snack.11 You will find that over time, if you are eating the right foods, you no longer feel the need for snacks. The wrong foods, on the other hand, simply make you hungrier. •   Avoid using all endocrine-disrupting products. •   Instead, you’ll consume the following: •   All leafy greens and certain vegetables, and a substantial amount of tubers and other foods that contain resistant starch. Initially, you will give fruit the boot. Later, you can reintroduce it only in its real season, and only as “candy.” •   Consume more omega-3 fats, particularly those found in fish oil, perilla oil, flaxseed oil, and other approved oils, such as avocado, walnut, olive, or macadamia nut, as well as medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), all of which allow speedy repair of the gut barrier. •   Consume no more than 8 ounces of animal protein a day (remember, fish and shellfish are animals), primarily as wild-caught fish and shellfish, which are high in omega-3 fatty acids and have no…

A pressure cooker will destroy the lectins in beans and other legumes, which are a fantastic source of nonvegetable protein, as well as in vegetables in the nightshade and squash families (actually fruits). Better yet, pressure-cooked beans, shorn of their offending lectins, serve as a smorgasbord for your gut buddies, and can improve longevity and enhance memory.

Coconut-Almond Flour Muffin in a Mug This tasty breakfast muffin takes just minutes to prepare. Double the recipe to make two muffins, and reheat the second muffin the following day to save even more time. You can play with the basic recipe by adding 1 teaspoon cocoa powder, lemon or orange zest, mint leaves, or any other herb or berry to change the flavor and add polyphenols or flavonoids. If you don’t have a microwave, pour the batter in a frying pan and serve it up as a pancake. Phases 2–3 Serves 1 Prep time: 3 minutes Cook time: 1–2 minutes 1 tablespoon extra-virgin coconut oil, melted 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil or macadamia nut oil 1 tablespoon coconut flour 1 tablespoon almond flour ½ teaspoon aluminum-free baking powder Pinch sea salt, preferably iodized 1 packet stevia, or 2 teaspoons Just Like Sugar 1 tablespoon water 1 large pastured or omega-3 egg, lightly beaten Place the ingredients in an 8- to 12-ounce microwave-safe mug, mixing well with a fork or spatula. Be sure to scrape the bottom and sides. Let it sit for a few seconds. Microwave on high for 1 minute plus 25 to 30 seconds. Using a pot holder, remove the mug from the microwave and invert, shaking out the muffin. Let cool for a couple of minutes before eating.

Cinnamon-Flaxseed Muffin in a Mug Grind fresh flaxseeds in a coffee grinder or store ground flaxseed in the refrigerator. Fresh flaxseeds have a nutty taste, but they are not the best-tasting ingredient in the world, which explains the generous amount of cinnamon in this recipe. If the taste is actually unpleasant, it means the flaxseed has turned rancid and should be discarded. Phases 2–3 Serves 1 Prep time: 3 minutes Cook time: 1 minute ¼ cup ground flaxseed 1 teaspoon cinnamon 1 large pastured or omega-3 egg 1 tablespoon extra-virgin coconut oil, melted 1 teaspoon aluminum-free baking powder 1 packet stevia Place all the ingredients in an 8- to 12-ounce microwave-safe mug, and mix well with a fork or spatula. Be sure to scrape the bottom and sides. Let it sit for a few seconds. Microwave on high for 1 minute. Check and cook for another 5 to 15 seconds if the muffin appears still wet in the center. Using a pot holder, remove the mug from the microwave and invert, shaking out the muffin. Let cool for a couple of minutes before eating.

Dr. G.’s New and Improved World-Famous Nut Mix Every patient who visits our office to give blood or see me is rewarded with ¼ cup of my nut mix to munch on. Based on copious data that nuts protect your heart, brain, and overall health, this mix has been a part of my program since its inception. We now know that the resistant starches in nuts are just what your gut buddies have been asking for! This is why they have the remarkable ability to make you feel full and satisfied for hours. My recipe originally contained peanuts and pumpkin seeds, but after seeing the effects of their lectins in a number of my patients, we modified the original mix about ten years ago to make it Plant Paradox friendly. Nuts are good for you, but only in moderation. Put them in snack bags in ¼ cup servings, or ladle them out with a ¼ cup measure. Phases 2–3 Makes 10 cups (40 servings) Prep time: 5 minutes 1 pound raw shelled walnuts in halves and pieces 1 pound raw shelled pistachios or salted and dry-roasted pistachios 1 pound raw shelled macadamia nuts* or salted and dry-roasted macadamias Put the nuts in a large bowl and stir with your hands or a spoon to mix well. Bag in individual servings and store in the refrigerator. *If raw macadamia nuts are in halves, they are most likely rancid. Use roasted ones instead.
